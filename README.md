this is a next.js 13 project, using the new experimental app router (and also my first fullstack project)

next.js features leveraged include server side rendering for performance, swr (to revalidate data when needed) and nextauth(kinda)

the front-end of the app is built using react, with tailwind for styling

the back-end of the app uses mongodb as its database (with mongoose)

all code is type-safe (hopefully) because of TypeScript

warning: no auth is implemented because of security issues with email and password auth (nextauth warns against this in the docs too) and because google is creepy
